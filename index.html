			<h2 class="decorative-font">About</h2>
			<p>
				I am a digital humanist, public historian, and web developer.  I focus my work on public-oriented outcomes, and am specifically concerned with making academic research applicable and available to wider audiences.  To this end, I leverage my background as a web developer to look for new ways to reach audiences and engage with academic historical research.
			</p>

			<p>
				I have been a web developer since 2012, with a short break to complete my MA in history, and took on the role of project manager and “Scrum Master” within my development teams.  I have experience working with modern web frameworks, such as Laravel and Ruby on Rails; databases, including MySQL and Postgres; and both new and established web trends, such as HTML5 and Sass.  I'm interested in questions of accessibility as it relates to web development as a whole and to digital humanities projects specifically.
			</p>

			<p>
				Outside of my work, I enjoy live music shows, fiction and epic literature, and shopping for midcentury-modern furniture.  At home, you'll usually find me drinking tea, writing letters, and spoiling my cat, Scout.
