			<h2 class="decorative-font">About</h2>
			<p>
				I am a museum technologist and digital humanist currently living and working in Bloomington, Indiana. I focus my work on public-oriented outcomes, and my most recent work has focused on increased accessibility of museums' digital offerings. To this end, I leverage my background in both IT and the humanities to develop strategies for meaningful, accessible engagement for all guests to engage with fine art.
			</p>

			<p>
				I have been a web developer since 2012, with a two-year break to complete my masters degree in history, and took on the role of project manager and “Scrum Master” within my development teams. In that role, I gained experience with a variety of modern web frameworks, databases, and both new and established web design tools. Through the lens of web projects, I consider questions of digital accessibility as a whole, and as it relates to art museum and digital humanities projects specifically.
			</p>

			<p>
				Outside of my work, I enjoy screen-free time to recharge. I'm into fantasy reading, site-specific theatre, playing D&D, and hanging out with my cat, Scout.
